# Solutions to everybody.codes

You'll find my solutions, in Julia, to [everybody.codes](https://everybody.codes) in the folders within.  I haven't included my inputs which need to be stored as puzzle number, `p` and then part number and `.txt` in the inputs folder for that year e.g. 2024's puzzle 5 part 2 filename would be `2024/inputs/5p2.txt`.

I've tidied them up a little so that they will display the solution to each part if the whole file is run, but otherwise they're as written for the competition.  I didn't hear about the competition until Puzzle 9 of 2024, so puzzles 1-8 of that year were done at a more leisurely pace as there was no possibility of placing on the leaderboard for them.
